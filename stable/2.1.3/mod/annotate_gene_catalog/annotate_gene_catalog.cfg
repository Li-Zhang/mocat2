# The REQUEST fields are options the module
# requires to run. Within barckets are the requested format
# The exact formatting here is important, that REQUEST
# is at the beginning of the line with a single space after
# ALSO, it is important that the fields that should be entered
# ie the name of a field or two groups do NOT contain any spaces.
# AND, yes, technically type below is the same os 'mode' for profiling
# but for technical reasons, 'mode' or any other already MOCAT specific
# option cannot be specified here
REQUEST blasttype [should be "blastp" normally for amino acid sequences, but can be set to "blastx"]

# The OPTIONAL fields can be entered, but are not required
# These two variables are the same as specified below in under module specific
# options, but whatever the user specifies on the command line will replace the settings below
#OPTIONAL A [desc]

# The OVERRIDE fields are module specific
# For this moduele, we do not require any type set
